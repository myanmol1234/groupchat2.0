# groupchat2.0

Hey ,This is ANMOL GOYAL, I have made this project to called GroupChat2.0 (named it as i have improved it after mutiple attempts) of the users using the nodejs, expressjs as server and mysql as database.
Flow of this project is like this : 

Initially user has to signup and then he will be redirected to login page. once the user is logined successfully , He /she will be redirected to group dashboard.
using that dashboard user can create groups and add members to that group( you know admin powers haha). #I have used features like token and bycrypt to add more authentication and more specification on this project.
# The key in this project is to understand the relationship b.w different tables (group,user,message)
hint: use one table to act like a buffer b/w the other two tables.
#Inside the server , we are using node js framwework (express js) to simply the server side logics, and features like routes to filter path and controllers to make code looks easy and sequelize to map to our mysql database using sync function. This is just a breif about the above project, you will learn more when you yourself try it!! thanks !!
